# sunshine

This is a simple weather application for Android.

Currently this app shows the weather temperature(celcius), summary and timezone of the users according to their current location.
The application repeats request per minute.

As weather API, I used Dark Sky API. https://darksky.net/

I also used Google location service , Retrofit and Gson libraries.

Implemented a simple MVP architecture in this application.
